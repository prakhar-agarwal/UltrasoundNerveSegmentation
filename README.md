Identify nerve structures in ultrasound images of the neck on Kaggle

Accurately identifying nerve structures in ultrasound images is a critical step in effectively inserting a patientâ€™s pain management catheter. In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to build a model that can identify nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the neck. Doing so would improve catheter placement and contribute to a more pain free future.
